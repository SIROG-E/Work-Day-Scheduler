## Homework 5:  Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This **project** was assembled to create a **simple calendar application** that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library was used to show current date and time.

## Description

- This app will allow user to create a schedule using this daily planner.
- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar when planner is opened. 
- User is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours when user scrolls down. 
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future when user views the timeblock for that day.
- User can enter an event when he/she clicks into a timeblock.
- The text for that event is saved in local storage when user clicks the save button for that timeblock.
- The saved events persist even when user refreshes the page. 


## Review

After completing this application I was able to create a daily calendar that stores in the local storage, the information entered by the user, and this information persists when page is refreshed. To complete this project I had to get help from many sites listed below:
